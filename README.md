# Simple Portfiolio

This is a very basic React-based portfolio I've created for personal use.
Feel free to use it as is or as a base for something else.

## Getting Started
- clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:InstantRamen/portfolio`
- open `src/data/data.json` and edit it to suit your needs.
